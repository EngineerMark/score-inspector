        question: "How do I get my own profile on this website?",
        answer: `Scroll up and join the osu!alternative Discord, 
        follow the instructions there and after approximately 10 hours, 
        your profile will be complete. 
        (It takes around this time to fetch ALL of your scores, you can visit before this is finished though)`
    },
    {
        question: "Why does it take so long to load a user?",
        answer: `We store nearly 80 million scores, filtering through all of them takes a bit. 
        Additionally theres some calculations happening during load, like different kinds of performance calculators, 
        preparing for all the scores and other stuff to be shown.`
    },
    {
        question: "Can I add other users to inspector?",
        answer: "No. The score fetcher requires you to login through osu! to start fetching your scores. If your REALLY want them here, ask them."
    },
    {
        question: "Something broke?",
        answer: "Report it on the osu!alternative Discord, and it'll likely be fixed in a next update. This will always be a work in progress."

        question: "Can I get a role?",
